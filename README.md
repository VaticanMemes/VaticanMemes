# Hi, I'm Harry 🤣

Beginner programmer from Sydney, Australia 🇦🇺.
Currently working on some simple web dev projects and getting through [theodinproject](theodinproject.com).
Interested in learning some more server-side stuff in the future.

Forget all industry best practices cause my method of coding is smacking my hands across the keyboard until I don't get an error message.

## Favourite projects

- 📖 [Library](https://vaticanmemes.github.io/js-library/)
- 📝 [To-do list](https://vaticanmemes.github.io/motherfucking-to-do-list/)
- 🐨 [Random koala](https://vaticanmemes.github.io/random-koala/)
- 💸 [Stock website](https://vaticanmemes.github.io/stock-website/)

All of these projects are rushed and underwhelming so beware (especially the stock website, which literally just gives you the price of the stock 🤷)
